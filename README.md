New Snake Game Enhancements:

Power-ups: Add special items for the snake to consume that give bonus points or slow down the game speed temporarily.

Obstacles: Introduce barriers on the screen that grow as the player progresses, making the game more challenging.

Custom Skins: Allow players to choose snake colors or textures.
New Features Added
Game Timer – Displays how long the player has been playing.

Live News Headline Cycling – Changes headline every time the snake eats food.

Game Over Screen with Final Time & Score – Shows how long the player lasted.
